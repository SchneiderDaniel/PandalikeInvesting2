            <h4>Investing</h4>
            Investing is hard. And most of the time, investing is also very stressful. Investing is about our hard-earned money and it also often gets somehow emotional. Therefore, I am always trying to search for investments that lets us sleep well. Investments that keep you relax like a panda. Ofc this is also not easy. But in the century that we live in, there are multiple ways of achieving this. Investing in index funds is one approach to this and it is the approach that I am focused on.

            <h4>Data Science/AI</h4>
            Data Science and AI is a field that has stunned me just recently. During my research, I was always into algorithms and data structures. But the possibilities that arise with artificial intelligence in combination with data is just amazing. I have not yet applied any knowledge from this field to my investing. But who knows what the future brings.

            <h4>Computer Science</h4>
            In my youth, I have already started programming, and coding was at my side since then. After I finished my master's degree in mathematics I decided to go for a Ph.D. in computer science. More precisely, in the field of algorithms and data structures. A few years back I successfully finished this part of my life and since then I apply computer science to my daily work. But the skills I have learned I am also applying to my private investing and this is the rise of this blog.

            <h4>Mathematics</h4>
            Numbers and the math behind them has always been something that got me interested. This is the reason I went for a university degree in math. Math has so many faces and most people, sadly, only get to know math from school which is just a fraction of the world of mathematics. Math can, especially in terms of investing, support you and it becomes really interesting when digging deeper. Back during my studies, I had to make a tough decision. The one route was to go for a math degree with the background of computer science and the other route was to go for a financial background. As a was interested in both topics, this was quite a hard decision to take and I, in the end, took computer science. I have never regretted this decision but therefore, investing and finance have remained my private pleasure.
